ook is funny
</p>
<p>
weird collection of<br>
ALL MY DEEPEST FEELINGS FOR<br>
MY 150 PEOPLE WIDE UNIVERSE and hyper-<br>
targeted ads for car insurance.
</p>
<p>
walking dead is filming in<br>
my driveway
</p>
<p>
(that is a change of<br>
subject and not poetry but<br>
oops now it's poetry)
</p>
<p>
(literally happening)
</p>
<p>
so there is a cop in my<br>
front yard
</p>
<p>
(I call the parking lot in<br>
front of our condo where<br>
the kids bump spanish-<br>
language hip hop and Kendrick and fix cars, etc.,<br>
my front yard)
</p>
<p>
and it's making me<br>
territorial.
</p>
<p>
Every few hours, I go out<br>
there, my gay ass half<br>
naked pride self - joggers<br>
and a grey tank top,<br>
shades. long hair. pink<br>
nails. keys and lighter<br>
lanyarded to my wrist
</p>
<p>
with a cup of coffee and a<br>
(small, I am old) joint
</p>
<p>
stand on one of the dirt<br>
islands in my asphalt front<br>
yard, one birkenstocked<br>
foot on the ground, one<br>
kicked back, sole against<br>
a tree
</p>
<p>
and smoke at him.
</p>
<p>
done it twice now
</p>
<p>
every time he gets<br>
increasingly aware of my<br>
presence. last time he<br>
touched (just touched, like<br>
to reassure himself) his<br>
gun
</p>
<p>
a little pat
</p>
<p>
I wonder how long I can<br>
keep doing this
</p>
<p>
and what he will do about<br>
it
</p>
<p>
because the thing is
</p>
<p>
he's on private property
</p>
<p>
doesn't look like it. but it
is.
</p>
<p>
it's a ticket, and I don't<br>
have id on me. why would<br>
I, in my front yard.
</p>
<p>
so.
</p>
<p>
Happy pride bro.
</p>
<p>
Honored to know you.
</p>
<p>
just thinking about shit
</p>
<p>
I'm good.
</p>
<p>
Just...having a hot one.
</p>
<p>
(you should come visit.)
</p>
<p>
it is so funny to me that<br>
this whole ass poem<br>
started because I typed<br>
"faceb" into here instead<br>
of the browser bar and<br>
was a little embarrassed<br>
and spun up a story to<br>
cover it
</p>
<p>
and now here we are
