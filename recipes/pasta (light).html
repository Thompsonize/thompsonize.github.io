<h1>Pasta (light)</h1>
<Br>
<p>
Boil water for pasta.
</p>
<p>
Halve and slice an onion (or the whites of a bunch of green onions) and add to a pan on medium-low with some fat. Sprinkle with italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper. Add a cubed chicken breast and, a few minutes later, some sliced garlic. Keep it moving; you don't want the garlic to burn. Adding the chicken should drop the pan temperature and give you some leeway but don't sleep on it. Add a sliced red pepper a few minutes later (and/or the scallion greens).
</p>
<p>
Drop some angel hair into the pot of salted water whenever it starts boiling.
</p>
<p>Juice and zest a lemon. Add half the juice and half the zest and more fat if necessary. keep it moving until the chicken is cooked through.
</p>
<p>
Drop the heat to low once the chicken and garlic are both cooked through. Add the remaining lemon juice and zest, and a handful of frozen peas.
</p>
<p>
Toss with cooked pasta and season. Top with far too much parmesan.
