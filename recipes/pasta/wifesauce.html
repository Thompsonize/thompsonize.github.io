<h1>Pasta: Wife Sauce</h1>
<Br>

<p>
This is a sauce my South Shore Italian wife likes that my Sicilian New Jersey childhood Christmases can accept - I’d prefer more of a bolognese, but throw a handful of mozzarella balls into this, do a pasta bake sometimes, bread crumbs, ziti, etc. and I’m good.
</p>
<p>
This is a Kenji Lopez-Alt recipe, halved and reworded for my brain. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
<ul>

<li>1/2 small supermarket package hot Italian sausage
<li>1ish carrot
<li>1/2ish white onion
<li>1/2ish rib celery
<li>an appropriate amount of garlic
<li>herbs (parsley is fine alone, but go nuts)
<li>a deglazing liquid
<li>1 large can crushed tomatoes (san marzanos or whatever, but honestly who cares)
<li>milk
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Heat some olive oil in a pan til smoking slightly. Add the sausage and fry it off. 
</p>
<p>
Once sausage is cooked through, add the carrot, onion, celery, and garlic. Cook til all vegetables are translucent.
</p>
<p>
Deglaze the pan with whatever you want, scraping as you go. I like sake, but red wine, white wine, beer, stock, or water all work. Once the liquid is reduced by half and is glossy and a little thick, add a large can of crushed tomatoes (or whole peeled blitzed once or twice with an immersion blender...which is how I remember what size to get in the moment at the market).
</p>
<p>
Add a heavy splash of milk. Stir to combine.
</p>
<p>
Simmer slowly, uncovered, til reduced by half, or until bubbles rising through the liquid are 1/2” - 1/4” across, somewhere between 45 and 90 minutes. 
</p>
<p>
Add a nice swirl of olive oil, stir til combined, kill the heat.
</p>
<p>
Cool completely. Portion into deli containers, top generously with fresh parsley, and freeze. I get 3 dinners out of this, which is as many times I want to eat it before I feel like making it again. Yes, you can easily double it and freeze more but that doesn’t work for me. If serving immediately (and why wouldn't you) 1/3 of the sauce over 5oz pasta feeds 2 comfortably. Can also be tossed with ziti or similar, topped with bread crumbs and parmesan and mozzarella, and baked.
