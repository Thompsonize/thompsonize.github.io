<h1>Pasta: Red</h1>
<Br>
<p>
This is pure Jersey, reduced down to absolute basics. Feeds 4 minimum for dinner with leftovers, scales easily.
</p>
<p>
Heat an enameled cast iron pot. Squeeze 2 full tray-length local supermarket brand hot italian sausages (about a pound) out of their casings and into the pot. Brown the sausage a little, breaking it apart. Add half a roughly chopped onion. Add Italian seasoning and hot red pepper flakes.
</p>
<p>
Cook until reduced by maybe 1/3. Drain if you want - I don't fry the sausage in oil as I break it apart so I usually don't bother, depending on how much fat is in the pan.
</p>
<p>
Add garlic powder to the pan and scrape around to toast. Add a large can of  San Marzano (or whatever) tomatoes. Mix together and scrape up fond. Cover. Reduce heat to low. Simmer for awhile. 

If you have a not-quite-enough-to-use-alone quantity of leftover tomato sauce in the freezer like I often do, add it into the pot while it simmers.
</p>
<p>
Preheat the oven to 325. 
</p>
<p>
Add as much Ziti to the pot as looks right, usually somewhere between 4oz-8oz. Add 1/2 cup hot water. Simmer low and slow until pasta is mostly done, about 20 minutes. Check every 5 minutes, adding more water as you need to, 1/2 cup at a time, to keep the sauce from burning and the pasta from sticking.
</p>
<p>
Take off heat. Add a handful of cubed low moisture mozzarella and stir to combine. Dust the surface with your preferred depth of grated Parmesan. 
</p>
<p>
Bake for 20ish minutes in the preheated oven to melt cheese - if it's too dry, with a lid on to retain moisture; if it's too wet, with the lid off to let it reduce.
</p>
<p>
Optionally, finish by turning up the oven to 425 for a few minutes if you want a little burned crunch on it. Breadcrumbs and/or ricotta can be added before you broil it but I usually don't bother.
