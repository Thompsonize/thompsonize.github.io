<h1>
Cube Bread
</h1>
<br>
<p>
I adore this weird little cube bread.
</p>
<p>
 Recipe initially from <a href="https://www.iceorrice.com/japanese-milk-bread-stand-mixer-bread-maker/">here</a> and halved and rounded, but I've iterated away from it a bit.
</p>
<p>
4x4x4 Pullman pans produce enough bread for 2 people to reliably use without it going stale first. Also: CUBE LOAF. I cannot overstate the physical satisfaction. It is the wrong shape and it is the perfect shape at the same time and I love it. But you can double or triple it if you want - nothing at all changes but the quantities and Pullman pans come in all sorts of lengths.
</p>
<p>
Measures below for 4x4x4 and 4x4x8, mostly for my own sanity.

</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>150g (300g) water or milk, warmed to 100F
<li>220g (440g) AP flour
<br>
<br>
Can sub 40g (80g) for rye and add 1tbsp (2tbsp) caraway seed (for texture) and 1 tsp (2tsp) ground caraway (for flavor) for perfect sandwich rye.
<br>
<br>
<li>15g (30g) sugar
<li>4g (8g) yeast
<li>5g (10g) salt
<li>25g (50g) salted butter (1/4 (1/2) stick)
</ul>
<p>
And a 4x4x4 (4x4x8) Pullman loaf pan, with lid.

<p>
Combine warm milk or water, flour, sugar, and yeast (and caraway, if you went tht route) in the bowl of a stand mixer with a dough hook attached. Mix on low until the dough clears the sides of the bowl (2 minutes) then knead on medium an additional 6 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Rest, covered, 15 minutes.
</p>
<p>Add the salt and the knob of butter and knead on medium for an additional 6 minutes. Keep an eye on the butter and make sure it incorporates; spatula it down if you need to. It will look, especially if you put your butter in at room temperature, like that amount of butter couldn't possibly all incorporate, but it will. There will be little to no butter on the sides of the mixing bowl when you're done and the dough will be silky and pliable.
</p>
<p>
Cover. Rise until doubled-ish, 60-90 minutes depending on the flour you used and how much of a boost the initial short pre-salt rest gave it. The dough is risen enough when it rebounds slowly but not completely when poked.
</p>
<p>
Knock back and invert, re-cover and rest an additional 30ish minutes, until near doubled.
</p>
<p>
Once doubled, you can either:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Roll the dough out into a largish (6x4 minimum) rectangle. Roll the dough, swiss roll-style and longways, squaring up the ends as you go. Pinch the bottom of the roll closed and form it into a "U," and place in the pan seam side down (doing this 3 times for a 4x4x8 loaf) making sure to fill the ends and sides of the pan tightly, 
<br>
<br>
or
<br>
<br>
<li>Drop the boule into the pan and squish it into the corners and call it good.
</ul>
<p>
The former yields a more uniform, consistent loaf but ; the latter is less work, and less fun.
</p>
<p>
Preheat the oven to 400F.
</p>
<p>
Final proof in the pan with the lid closed until the dough rises to just touch the inside lid of the pan in the center, about 45 minutes. Do not overproof or the loaf will ooze out the seams in the oven.
</p>
<p>
Lid the pan and bake 35 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Remove from the tin and cool completely on wire rack before slicing, about 1 hour, to avoid a waist.
</p>
<p>
If you happen to have an open jar of sweetened condensed milk in the fridge and you want the bread to have a milkier, softer texture, you can add a tsp to the initial dough mixture. It's novel but it isn't worth opening a can for.
