<h1>
Bread: Cube Bread
</h1>
<br>
<p>
I adore this weird little cube bread.
</p>
<p>
 Recipe from <a href="https://www.iceorrice.com/japanese-milk-bread-stand-mixer-bread-maker/">here</a>, halved and rounded.
</p>
<p>
4x4x4 Pullman pans produce enough bread for 2 people to reliably use without it going stale first. Also: CUBE LOAF. I cannot overstate the physical satisfaction. It is the wrong shape and it is the perfect shape at the same time and I love it.

<br>
<ul>
<li>150g water or milk, warmed in a saucepan or microwave to 100F
<li>220g flour (AP, or whatever)
<li>15g sugar
<li>2g yeast
<li>5g salt
<li>25g (1/4 stick) salted butter
</ul>
<p>
And a 4x4x4 Pullman loaf pan, with lid.

<p>
Combine warm milk or water, flour, sugar, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer with a dough hook attached. Mix on low until the dough clears the sides of the bowl (2 minutes). Add salt and knead on medium for an additional 6 minutes.
</p>
<p>Add the knob of butter with the mixer still on medium and knead for an additional 6 minutes. Keep an eye on the butter and make sure it incorporates; spatula it down if you need to. There will be little to no butter on the sides of the mixing bowl when you're done and the dough will be silky and pliable.
</p>
<p>
Cover. Rise 90ish minutes. Dough is risen enough when it rebounds slowly but not completely when poked.
</p>
<p>
  Knock back, pull and pinch into a boule, cover again and rest an additional 30ish minutes, until doubled.
</p>
<p>
Once doubled, you can either:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Roll the dough out into a largish (6x4 minimum) rectangle. Roll the dough, swiss roll-style and longways, squaring up the ends as you go. Pinch the bottom of the roll closed and form it into a "U," and place in the pan seam side down, making sure to fill the ends and sides tightly, or
<li>Drop the boule into the pan and squish it into the corners and call it good
</ul>
<p>
The former yields a more uniform, consistent loaf; the latter is less work, and less fun.
</p>
<p>
Preheat the oven to 400F.
</p>
<p>
Final proof in the pan with the lid closed until the dough rises to fill 3/4 - 4/5 the pan (about 45 minutes). Do not overproof or the loaf will have nowhere to grow in the oven.
</p>
<p>
Lid the pan and bake 30 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Cool completely on wire rack before slicing, about 1 hour, to avoid a waist. If the bread ends up too soft to slice, keep the back time at 30 minutes but up the heat to 425.
</p>
<p>
If you happen to have an open jar of sweetened condensed milk in the fridge and you want the bread to have a milkier, softer texture, you can add a tsp to the initial dough mixture. It's novel but it isn't worth opening a can for.
