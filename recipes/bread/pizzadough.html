10" pizza dough:

<li>200g AP flour
<li>2g sugar
<li>2g yeast
<li>150g water
<li>5g salt
<li>5g canola oil
</ul>

<li>20g canola oil
</ul>
<p>
Toppings:

</ul>

<p>
Combine flour, sugar, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer with a dough hook attached. Add water and mix on low until the dough clears the sides of the bowl (2 minutes) then continue to knead an additional few minutes.
</p>
<p>
Rest, covered, 15 minutes.
</p>
<p>Add the salt and the oil and knead on medium for an additional 10 minutes. It will look like that amount of oil couldn't possibly all incorporate, but it will, then  continue to work until satisfied - there will be little to no oil on the sides of the mixing bowl when you're done and the dough will hold together while remaining pliable and (very) silky. You may need to add a little flour to get it to pull together.
</p>
<p>
Rise until doubled-ish, 60-90 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Knock back from the bottom while trying to keep the top intact (a spatula down the sides of the bowl, tucking the sides further under the ball works.) Re-cover and rest an additional 30ish minutes, until near doubled.
</p>
<p>
Once doubled again, preheat the oven to 550F. Invert the dough into the 10" bottom of a generously cornmealed 12" skillet (bubbly side up) and push gently from center to edge, rotating the pan as you go, until the bottom of the pan is covered. Create an edge crust by pressing the edge of the disk between your fingers and press down the center of the dough so it is of even thickness.
</p>
<p>
Spoon a few tablespoons of tomato sauce onto the dough and spread out with the back of the spoon. Aim for half red, half translucent. Top with 2oz low moisture cheese, a scant drizzle of olive oil (for flavor not fat) and pepper (the sauce has salt.) optionally top with some combination of red pepper flakes, italian seasoning, garlic powder, and fresh grated parmesan cheese.
</p>
<p>
 Bake at the center of the oven 4 minutes, rotate 180 degrees, and bake an additional 4 minutes, then set the oven to broil, move the pizza to under the heating element, and broil 1 more minute until cheese is appropriately charred. 
</p>
<p>
If making 4x the recipe with intent to freeze: after the primary 90 minute proof and knockback, divide dough into 4 350g balls, place each ball in an oiled pint deli container and swirl to oil top. proof til almost full (1/2" headspace), lid, and freeze.
