<p>
Combine flour, sugar, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer with a dough hook attached. Add water and mix on low until the dough clears the sides of the bowl (2 minutes) then continue to knead an additional few minutes.
</p>
<p>
Rest, covered, 15 minutes.
</p>
<p>Add the salt and the oil and knead on medium for an additional 10 minutes. It will look like that amount of oil couldn't possibly all incorporate, but it will, then  continue to work until satisfied - there will be little to no oil on the sides of the mixing bowl when you're done and the dough will hold together while remaining pliable.
</p>
<p>
coat lightly in oil and cover. Rise until doubled-ish, 60-90 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Knock back from the bottom while trying to keep the top intact (a spatula down the sides of the bowl, tucking the sides further under the ball works.) Re-cover and rest an additional 30ish minutes, until near doubled.
</p>
<p>
Once doubled again, preheat the oven to 550F. Invert the dough into the 10" bottom of a generously cornmealed 12" skillet (bubbly side up) and push gently from center to edge, rotating the pan as you go, until the bottom of the pan is covered. Create an edge crust by pressing the edge of the disk between your fingers and press down the center of the dough so it is of even thickness.
</p>
<p>
Spoon 80g tomatoes onto the dough and spread out with the back of the spoon til even. top with 4oz low moisture cheese, a scant drizzle of olive oil (for flavor not fat) and salt and pepper.
<p>
 Bake 5" from top heating element for 4 minutes, rotate 180 degrees, and bake an additional 4 minutes +1-2 more until cheese is appropriately charred.
