Bread: Milk bread

<br>
<p>
Milk bread is Wonder Bread without the crap.<br>
It is an amazing weekday sandwich loaf.
</p>
<p>
 Recipe from <a href="https://www.iceorrice.com/japanese-milk-bread-stand-mixer-bread-maker/">here</a>; standardized and w/ rounded off measures for easier replication.

</p>
<ul>
<li>440g flour (bread flour suggested but whatever you've got is fine)
<li>290g milk
<li>25g sugar
<li>13g (2 tsp) sweetened condensed milk
<li>4g yeast
<li>10g salt
<li>55g (1/2 stick) softened butter
</ul>
<p>
You also really do need a Pullman pan to pull this off right, though any 4x8 loaf pan will do.
</p>
<p>
Combine flour, milk, sugar, sweetened condensed milk, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer with a dough hook. Mix on low for 2 minutes, add salt, and knead on medium for 6 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Add butter in largish chunks with mixer still on medium, adding more as the chunks are incorporated. It will take an additional 5-6 minutes while adding butter to get there. The dough will be pulled together and there should be little to no butter on the sides of the mixing bowl when you're done, with a final temperature of ~80F. If the butter is not soft when it goes into the mixer you will over-knead it.
</p>
<p>
Rise 1-2 hours. Dough is risen enough when it rebounds slowly but not completely when poked.
</p>
<p>
Divide the dough into 3 equal pieces by weight (approx 275g per) and round into boules. Cover and bench rest 20-30 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Roll a piece out into a 4"x6" square. Fold and roll lengthwise toward you into a neat roll (Square up the ends as you go) and bend into a U. Place it into one end of the pullman pan, seam down. Repeat for the second piece and place it on the other end of the pan in the same orientation. Do the last one and place in the middle, rotated 180 degrees (like this: unu). Keep the ends and sides tight against the walls.
</p>
<p>
Final proof in the pan until the dough rises to fill 3/4 - 4/5 the pan (about 1 hour, but could be longer).
</p>
<p>
Preheat the oven during final proof to 400F.
</p>
<p>
Lid the pan and bake for 25-30 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Tap the pan solidly against the counter a few times to free the loaf. Cool completely on wire rack before slicing.
</p>
<p>
This stuff keeps perfectly fine (for as long as it remains uneaten...) cut-side down on a silpat or cutting board. You can keep it softer and longer in a plastic bag, or on the counter, cut side down, with a bag loosely over it - this is a very moist loaf and moist loaves don't like being completely sealed in plastic.
</p>
<p>
I am <em>pretty sure</em> (but haven't explicitly confirmed yet) that you can leave the sweetened condensed milk out. Don't sub in milk by weight though, it makes the finished bread too soft to slice cleanly and can't hold even slightly moist sandwich fillings.
