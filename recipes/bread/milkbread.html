</p>
<p>
 Recipe from <a href="https://www.iceorrice.com/japanese-milk-bread-stand-mixer-bread-maker/">here</a>; standardized and w/ rounded off measures for easier replication. numbers for a 4"x4"x4" and 4"x4"x8" pan

<ul>
<li>220g/440g flour (bread flour suggested but whatever you've got is fine)
<li>150g/290g milk
<li>12g/25g sugar
<li>2g/4g yeast
<li>5g/10g salt
<li>25g/55g (1/4 or 1/2 stick) softened butter
</ul>
<p>
You also really do need a Pullman pan to pull this off right, though any 4x8 loaf pan will do. 4x4 Pullman pans produce enough bread for 2 people to reliably use without it going stale first, and there is something hugely satisfying about a cubic bread loaf.

<p>
Warm milk to 100F in a small saucepan or microwave.
</p>
<p>Combine warm milk, flour, sugar, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer with a dough hook attached. Mix on low until the dough clears the side of the bowl (2 minutes), add salt, and knead on medium for 6 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Add butter in largish chunks with mixer still on medium, adding more as the chunks are incorporated. It will take an additional 5-6 minutes while adding butter to get there. The dough will be pulled together and there should be little to no butter on the sides of the mixing bowl when you're done, with a final temperature of ~80F. If the butter is not soft when it goes into the mixer you will over-knead it.
</p>
<p>
Rise 1-2 hours. Dough is risen enough when it rebounds slowly but not completely when poked.
</p>
<p>
Divide the dough into 3 equal pieces by weight (approx 275g per) and round into boules; half loafs do not have to be divided. Cover with a wet kitchen towel and bench rest 20-30 minutes, until doubled.
</p>
<p>
Once doubled, take a boule and roll it out into a 4"x6" square. Fold and roll lengthwise toward you into a neat roll (Square up the ends as you go) and bend into a U. Repeat for the remaining boules.
</p>
For a 4x8 loaf:  place one "U" into each end of the pullman pan, seams down, in the same orientation. Do the same to the remaining piece and place in the middle, rotated 180 degrees, so when finished the loaf look like this from the top down: unu. Keep the ends and sides tight against the walls.
</p>
<p>
For a 4x4 loaf: Half loaf boules can be rolled this way as well as a single "U" and placed in the pan for a more consistent loaf, or more simply punched down and placed straight into the pan for less hassle.
</p>

<p>
Final proof in the pan with the lid closed until the dough rises to fill 3/4 - 4/5 the pan (about 1 hour). Do not overproof.
</p>
<p>
Preheat the oven during final proof to 400F.
</p>
<p>
Lid the pan and bake. 4x8: 25-30 minutes. 4x4: 20-25 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Tap the pan solidly against the counter a few times to free the loaf. Cool completely on wire rack before slicing.
