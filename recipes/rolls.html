<h1>Rolls</h1>

<ul>
<li>10g yeast
<li>190g water
<li>25g sugar
<li>455g flour
<li>12g salt
<li> 20g canola oil
</ul>
<p>
Also:
</p>

<ul>
<li>cooking spray
<li>(optional) cornmeal
</ul>
<p>
Add all ingredients to a stand mixer bowl. You can proof the yeast with the  water and sugar first if you don't trust it, but it isn't otherwise necessary. 
</p>
<p>
Mix 3 minutes; let rest 10 minutes; mix another 3-5 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Turn dough out onto a bench and knead with additional flour until the dough loses enough stickiness to hold together; Processed flours need much more additional flour vs local/stone ground flours.
</p>
<p>
Return to a bowl and cover with a lid or towel. Proof 2 hours.
</p>
<p>
Gently knock the air out of the dough and invert it; proof 1.5-2 more hours.
</p>
<p>
 Gently roll dough into approx. 100g balls, pinch the seams to seal, and arrange apart on silpatted and/or cornmealed baking sheet.
</p>
<p>
Spray rolls with cooking spray, cover with second inverted baking sheet, and allow to proof an additional 60-90 minutes, until large but before they start to spread and flatten.
</p>
<p>
Towards the end of the final proof, preheat oven to 500F.
</p>
<p>
Bake 5 minutes on lowest rack, lower heat to 450F, and bake an additional 5-7 minutes til brown. Try not to open the oven too much.
</p>
<p>
Cool on wire rack 10-15 minutes before eating; cool completely before storing.
