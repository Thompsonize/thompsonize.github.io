Japanese Milk Bread
</h1>
<p>
Milk bread is basically Wonder Bread without the crap. It is an amazing weekday sandwich loaf.
</p>
<p>
 Recipe from <a href="https://www.iceorrice.com/japanese-milk-bread-stand-mixer-bread-maker/">here</a>; standardized and w/ rounded off measures for easier replication.
<p>
<ul>
<li>440g flour (bread flour suggested but whatever you've got is fine)
<li>290g milk
<li>25g sugar
<li>13g (2 tsp) sweetened condensed milk
<li>4g yeast
<li>10g salt
<li>55g (1/2 stick) softened butter
</ul>
</p>
<p>
You also really do need a Pullman pan to pull this off right
</p>
<p>
Add flour, milk, sugar, sweetened condensed milk, and yeast to the bowl of a stand mixer with a dough hook. Mix on low speed for 2 minutes, add salt, and knead on medium for 6 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Add butter in largish chunks with mixer still on medium, adding more as it is incorporated. The final dough's temperature should be 79-82F and it will take an additional 5-6 minutes while adding butter to get there. The dough will be pulled together and there should be little to no butter on the sides of the mixing bowl when you're done.
</p>
<p>
Rise 60 minutes. Dough is risen enough when it rebounds slowly but not completely when poked.
</p>
<p>
Divide the dough into 3 equal pieces by weight. Fold and round each piece. Cover and bench rest 20 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Roll a piece out into a 4x6 square. Roll lengthwise toward you into a neat roll (Square up the ends as you go) and bend into a U. Place it into one end of the pullman pan, seam down. Repeat for the second piece and place it on the other end of the pan Do the last one and place in the middle, rotated 180 degrees. Keep the ends tight against the walls.
</p>
<p>
Final proof in the pan until the dough rises to fill 3/4 - 4/5 the pan (about 1 hour, but could be longer).
</p>
<p>
Preheat the oven during final proof to 400F.
</p>
<p>
Cover the pan with its lid and bake for 25-30 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Tap the pan against the counter to remove. Cool completely on wire rack before slicing.
</p>
<p>
This stuff keeps perfectly fine (for as long as it remains uneaten...) cut-side down on a silpat or cutting board
