<h1>Pasta (Red)</h1>
<Br>
<p>
This is pure Jersey, reduced down to absolute basics. Feeds 2 for dinner with leftovers, scales easily.
</p>
<p>
Heat an enameled cast iron pot. Squeeze 3 (ideally local supermarket brand) hot italian sausages out of their casings into the pot. Brown the sausage a little, breaking it apart. Add half a roughly chopped onion. If you want, add some Italian seasoning and/or hot red pepper flakes. You don't need to, it's literally what's inside the hot Italian sausage. I do it because it's fun.
</p>
<p>
Cook until reduced by maybe 1/3. Drain if you want - sometimes I don't bother, depending on how much fat we're talking about.
</p>
<p>
Add a large can of crushed (or whatever) San Marzano (or whatever) tomatoes. Mix together. Cover. Reduce heat to low. Simmer for awhile. 
</p>
<p>
Preheat the oven to 325. 
</p>
<p>
Boil some water. Make some rigatoni or ziti or whatever. Cook it shy of al dente.
</p>
<p>
Strain the pasta and put in a glass loaf pan. Add sauce a little at a time, stirring as you go, until you get the ratio you want. Freeze the rest of the sauce, or keep it in the fridge for a bit with the leftover mozzarella for parms. If your mozzarella is low moisture, shoot for a wetter sauce, otherwise less (or more meaty) parts of the sauce.
</p>
<p>
Top with grated (or canned) parmesan and sliced mozzarella. Bake for a bit (20ish minutes) to melt cheese, then turn up the oven to 450 for a few minutes to brown it if you want.
