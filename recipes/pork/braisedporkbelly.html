<h1>PORK: BRAISED PORK BELLY</h1>
<br>
<p>
Suspiciously easy for what you end up with. Recipe is for dinner for 2.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>8oz pork belly, cut into 1" cubes. 
<li>1 (or 2 small) green onion, cut into 2" pieces
<li>2 slices ginger, smashed
<li>2 cloves of garlic, peeled
<li>1/4 cup shaoxing wine
<li>1 tbsp light soy sauce
<li>1 tbsp dark soy sauce
<li>1/2 tbsp sugar
<li>
<li>
<li>
<li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Put cubed pork belly in a small saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, skimming foam from the water as it appears until water is mostly clear (3ish minutes.)
</p>
<p>
Remove pork belly from pot; clean pot and return pork belly to it, along with green onion, garlic and ginger. Add 1/4 cup shaoxing wine and enough water to just cover the pork. Add light and dark soy sauce and sugar.
</p>
<p>
Bring to a boil and reduce temperature to a simmer. Simmer, covered, 60-90 minutes, until pork is tender. More water can be added if necessary to continue cooking if it boils off too fast.
