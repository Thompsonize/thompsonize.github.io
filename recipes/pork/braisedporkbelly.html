<h1>PORK: BRAISED PORK BELLY</h1>
<br>
<p>
Very easy for what you end up with. Recipe is for dinner portion for 2.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>8oz pork belly, cut into 1/2" - 1" pieces each containing both fat and lean 
<li>2 green onion, cut into 2" pieces
<li>2 large slices ginger, smashed
<li>3 cloves of garlic, peeled
<li>1/2 cup shaoxing wine
<li>1 tbsp light soy sauce
<li>1 tbsp dark soy sauce
<li>1 tbsp sugar
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Cover pork belly with water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, skimming foam from the water as it appears until water is mostly clear (3ish minutes.)
</p>
<p>
Strain pork and return to pot, along with green onion, garlic and ginger. Add 1/2 cup shaoxing wine and enough water to just cover the pork. Add light and dark soy sauce and sugar.
</p>
<p>
Bring to a boil and reduce temperature to a simmer. Simmer, covered, 60-90 minutes, until pork is tender and remaining water and sugar have thickened into a sauce. More water can be added if necessary to continue braising if necessary.
