<h1>Coffee</h1>

<p>
I was a coffee snob for years. It was fun while it lasted, but I eventually realized the cost-benefit had swung the other way when I wasn't looking.
</p>
<p>
So: to make enough slightly-better-than-supermarket-brand light-to-medium roast coffee for 2 people's morning, in a Chemex:
</p>
<p>
Boil 1l filtered water
</p>
<p>
Grind 20ish grams of coffee. This is half the golden grounds-to-coffee, 18:1 ratio. This is intentional. On my grinder, that's just shy of 15 seconds. Grind to one notch closer to espresso than the pourover setting; the grind will be about halfway between granulated sugar and kosher salt.
</p>
<p>
Put a filter in the Chemex and rinse it with 200ml of the boiled water. Swirl it around to warm the glass (or not) and pour it out.
</p>
<p>
Put the ground coffee in the filter. Wet the grounds and let them bloom for a bit, maybe a minute but it doesn't really matter, to release bound up nitrogen.
</p>
<p>
Pour through the remaining water. You can time this if you want but honestly I don't bother. Both filling the cone quickly twice and filling it slowly once will work depending on how much focus you've got in the moment. However you do it, it's important you remove the grounds and filter and decant as soon as the coffee finishes dripping through, as letting the end of the water filter through will bitter the pot.
</p>
<p>
That's it. Minimum focus, no weighing, no timing, 1/4 the price of a "correctly" brewed pot (thanks to using less, cheaper coffee) but still a better (and more meditative) pot than a mr. coffee could make.
