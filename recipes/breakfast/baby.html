<h1>Breakfast: Dutch Baby</h1>
<br>
<p>
Angela makes these for breakfast sometimes and the effort to deliciousness ratio is high.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>3/4 cup ap flour
<li>3/4 cup milk
<li>3 eggs
<li>3 tbsp sugar
<li>2 tsp vanilla
<li>3/4 tsp salt
<li>2.5 tbsp butter (for the pan)
<br>
<br>
For serving: butter, jelly, syrup, fruit, cooked apples and cinnamon, powdered sugar, etc.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Put all ingredients excepting the butter and toppings in a blender. Blend 10 seconds, scrape down the sides, and blend another 10 seconds. (Angela uses a stick blender and a big cup).
</p>
<p>
Let the batter rest 20ish minutes so the flour hydrates; meanwhile, pre-heat a large (12") cast iron skillet in a 400F oven.
</p>
<p>
After the 20 minutes are up and the pan is hot, add the butter to the pan and return the pan to the oven briefly to melt the butter. Once the butter is melted, remove the pan from the oven, tilting it to coat it with the butter.
</p>
<p>
Blend the batter one last time and pour it into the hot pan.
</p>
<p>
Return the pan to the oven and bake until the pancake is puffed up and golden brown with crispy, darker brown edges, approx 20 minutes
</p>
<P>
Remove from oven. Cut into slices with kitchen shears. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and eat with fruit or jam, syrup, etc. 
</p>
<p>
1 pancake made this way stuffs 2 people.
