<h1>Breakfast: Dutch Baby</h1>
<br>
<p>
Angela makes these for breakfast sometimes and the effort to deliciousness ratio is high.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>3/4 cup ap flour
<li>3/4 cup milk
<li>3 egg
<li>3 Tbsp sugar
<li>1.5 tsp Vanilla
<li>3/4 tsp salt
<li>slightly less than 3 tbsp butter (for the pan)
<br>
<br>
For serving: butter, jelly, syrup, fruit, Cooked apples and cinnamon, powdered sugar, etc.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Put all ingredients but the butter and toppings in a blender. Blend 10 seconds, scrape it down, and blend another 10 seconds. (Angela uses a stick blender and a big cup).
</p>
<p>
Let the batter rest 20ish minutes to hydrate the flour.
</p>
<p>
In the interim, pre-heat a cast iron pan in a 400F oven.
</p>
<p>
After the 20 minutes are up, melt the butter in the hot pan and tilt the pan around so it's coated with butter.
</p>
<p>
Blend the batter one last time and pour it into the hot pan.
</p>
<p>
Bake until the pancake is puffed up and golden brown with crispy, darker brown edges, approx 20 minutes
</p>
<P>
Cut into slices with kitchen shears. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and eat with fruit or jam, syrup, etc.
