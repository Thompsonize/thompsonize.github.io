<h1>PICKLES: RED ONIONS</h1>
<br>
<p>
Boil 200ml water and 200ml white vinegar in a saucepan with 2 tsp each salt and sugar and take off heat to slightly cool.
</p>
<p>
Pack 1/2 of a mandolined red onion and 1 tbsp black peppercorns into a clean 600ml wide-mouthed mason jar.
</p>
<p>
Slowly pour the still-steaming vinegar solution over the onions so the onions are completely covered but headspace remains in the jar, and lid.
</p>
<p>
Can be used after 20 minutes steeping. Cool to room temperature on counter, then move to the fridge. Use within a month or so.
