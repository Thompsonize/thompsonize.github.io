<h1>Chicken: Tacos</h1>
<br>
<p>
This hits the spot (better) than the taco bell not delivering to you leaves.
</p>
<p>
Trim fat from boneless skinless chicken thighs.
</p>
<p>
Create a marinade from adobo, freshly toasted and ground cumin seed, 2 pressed garlic cloves, finely chopped fresh culantro, salt,  tomato chicken powder, sugar, black pepper, a chopped chile canned in adobo and a little sauce, fish sauce, the juice of a lime (or half an acidic orange, or some pickled jalapeno etc juice, or vinegar, or a combination) and olive oil, thinned as necessary from a paste with a little water. 
<p>
Dredge chicken thighs thoroughly in marinade and layer in a sturdy bowl. Top with remaining liquid, and pierce the stacked chicken thighs repeatedly and thoroughly with (metal or plastic, not wood or disposable) chopsticks, or skewers.
</p>
<p>
Marinate at room temperature an hour, or in the fridge for longer.
</p>
<p>
Preheat broiler. Arrange chicken in 1 layer on an oven rack over a pan. Broil 3" from element until edges are crispy, 10-12 minutes, then flip to finish (5ish minutes). Crispier is better. Cool and slice.
</p>
<p>
Concurrently, warm corn tortillas in a dry pan over medium and keep in a folded towel. Assemble and top as desired.
