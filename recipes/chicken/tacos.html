<h1>Chicken: Tacos</h1>
<br>
<p>
This hits the spot (better) that the taco bell not delivering to you leaves.
</p>
<p>
Trim fat from boneless skinless chicken thighs.
</p>
<p>
Create a marinade from adobo, salt, chicken tomato powder, sugar, black pepper, freshly toasted and ground cumin seed, a chopped chile canned in adobo, the juice of a lime (or half an acidic orange, or some pickled jalapeno etc juice, or white, wine, or apple vinegar, or a combination) and olive oil. 
<p>
Dredge chicken thighs throughly in marinade and layer in a glass bowl or measuring cup or similar container with a sturdy bottom. Top with remaining liquid, and pierce the stacked chicken thighs repeatedly with (metal or plastic, not wood or disposable) chopsticks, or skewers.
</p>
<p>
Marinate at room temperature an hour (or in the fridge for longer)
</p>
<p>
Preheat broiler. Arrange chicken in 1 later on an oven rack over a pan. Broil 3"-4" from top element until edges are crispy, 10ish minutes, then flip to finish (5ish minutes). Crispier is better. Cool and slice.
<p>
Warm corn tortillas in a warm dry pan and keep in a folded towel. Assemble and top as desired.
