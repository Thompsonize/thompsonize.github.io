<h1>Chicken: Chicken Soup</h1>
<br>
<p>
Molly Baz' chicken soup, halved and subbed with things I typically have on hand and streamlined - green onion for white, leeks for celery.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>4 chicken thighs
<li>1lb chicken feet
<li>2 leeks, whites separated from greens and halved and rinsed, with the whites of one leek chopped and reserved
<li>1 large carrot, half roughly sectioned, half reserved as with the leeks
<li>1 bunch green onion, topped and halved
<li>1 head garlic, halved across the middle
<li>1 tbsp black peppercorns
<li>1 bunch dill
<li>10g (still to quantify this, quantity matters) rice or pasta per person
<li>(optional) a few mushrooms (button etc are fine ofc; enoki is great)
<li>(optional) fresh lemon juice
</ul>









</ul>
</p>
<p>
All the chicken goes into a pot/wok/etc. cover with water, raise to boiling, and drop to a simmer. Skim foam til liquid is acceptably clearer, 20-30 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Add everything else except the reserved chopped vegetables and half the dill. Return to a simmer and cook (still occasionally skimming) til chicken is tender and broth is fatty - about an hour.
</p>
<p>
Remove and cool chicken thighs; strain broth and discard remaining solids.
</p>
<p>
Reassemble: add broth to a pan/wok with reserved chopped vegetables (and optionally some mushrooms if you want.)
</p>
<p>
Add a small quantity of starch if desired - orzo or ditalini or similar small pastas are good, as is rinced rice or ramen etc. noodles - and simmer til all is warmed through.
</p>
<p>
You can cook pasta separately to keep the broth from clouding if that matters to you.
</p>
<p>
Salt once all is cooked and reduced. A squeeze of lemon can be a nice finisher with more dill or other herbs - parsley's good.
