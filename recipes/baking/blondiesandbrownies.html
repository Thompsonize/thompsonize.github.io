<h1>BAKING: BLONDIES AND BROWNIES</h1>
<br>
<p>
Blondie recipe built for a 6" pan. For 8x8, double everything more or less (190g flour, and an egg and a yolk vs 2 eggs) and bake for the same time. 
</p>
<p>
Easily convertible to an as-good brownie recipe - melt 50g chocolate chips into the butter til smooth and decrease flour to 50g.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>3/4 stick (85g) butter (melted; I use salted butter)
<li>if making brownies: 50g semi-sweet chocolate chips
<li>150g light brown sugar
<li>1 tsp vanila extract
<li>1 beaten egg
<br>
<br>
<li>100g all purpose flour (50g if brownies)
<li>1/4 tsp fine salt
<li>1/8 tsp baking powder
<br>
<br>
<li>30g crushed pecans
<li>15g chocolate chips
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Preheat oven to 350F. grease and/or line a 6" square baking pan.
</p>
<p>
Gently melt butter (do not allow to steam or reduce). Melt in 50g chocolate chips if making brownies.
</p>
<p>
Pour over sugar in a mixing bowl. Add vanilla. Stir til combined.
</p>
<p>
Ensure sugar mixture is not steaming; stir in beaten egg.
</p>
<p>
Add flour and baking powder and salt, and stir with a rubber spatula til just smooth.
</p>
<p>
Pour batter into pan. Top with 30g crushed pecans and 15g chocolate chips and bake (middle rack) for 25-28 minutes, until toothpick comes out mostly clean; a few crumbs is fine. Allow to fully set on wire rack, 2 hours, before cutting. For fudgier brownies, store in fridge.
