<h1>BAKING: BLONDIES</h1>
<br>
<p>
Basically perfect and dead simple. From <a href="https://handletheheat.com/blondie-recipe/">here</a>, halved for a 6" pan. For 8x8, double everything more or less (191g flour, and an egg and a yolk vs 2 eggs) and bake for the same time. 

</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>3/4 stick (85g) unsalted butter (melted)
<li>150g light brown sugar
<li>1 tsp vanila extract
<li>1 beaten egg
<br>
<li>100g all purpose flour
<li>1/4 tsp fine salt
<li>1/8 tsp baking powder
<br>
<li>100g mixins (I do semisweet chocolate chips and walnuts)
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Preheat oven to 350F. grease and/or line a 6" square baking pan.
</p>
<p>
Gently melt butter. Whisk butter and light brown sugar in a mixing bowl til smooth. Add room-temperature egg (room temperature so it isn't so much colder than the butter and sugar that it scrambles when it hits it, but that really isn't a problem if you don't overheat the butter when you melt it, or if you cool the butter and sugar a bit before you add the egg.)
</p>
<p>
Add flour and baking powder and salt and stir to combine. Mix in additional ingredients, spatula into pan, and bake (middle rack) for 25ish minutes. Cool at least a little before cutting.
