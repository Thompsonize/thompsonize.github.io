<h1>BAKING: BLONDIES</h1>
<br>
<p>
Basically perfect and dead simple. From <a href="https://handletheheat.com/blondie-recipe/">here</a>, halved for a 6" pan. For 8x8, double everything more or less (191g flour, and an egg and a yolk vs 2 eggs) and bake for the same time. 

</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>3/4 stick (85g) butter (melted; I use salted butter)
<li>150g light brown sugar
<li>1 tsp vanila extract
<li>1 beaten egg
<br>
<li>100g all purpose flour
<li>1/4 tsp fine salt
<li>1/8 tsp baking powder
<br>
<li>100g mixins
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Preheat oven to 350F. grease and/or line a 6" square baking pan.
</p>
<p>
Gently melt butter (do not allow to steam or reduce). Pour over sugar in a mixing bowl and whisk til smooth.
</p>
<p>
Add room-temperature egg (room temperature so it isn't so much colder than the butter and sugar that it scrambles when it hits it, but that isn't a problem if you don't overheat the butter when you melt it.)
</p>
<p>
Add flour and baking powder and salt and stir with a rubber spatula til smooth, approx 50 strokes. Don't overdo it.
</p>
<p>
Mix in additional ingredients, spatula into pan, and bake (middle rack) for 25-30 minutes, until toothpick comes out mostly clean; a few crumbs is fine. Cool at least a little before cutting.
</p>
<p>
Current best advice for mixins: 60g (a scant spoonful or so) of Fluff gently mixed into the batter before pouring into the pan - do not over-stir, batter should be  zebra-striped - topped evenly and densely with enough crushed pecans that you can no longer see the batter (50-75g? idk but don't skimp) then and dotted with good quality semi-sweet chocolate chips. The nuts will express oils as the blondies bake, darkening the surface - do not mistake this for over-baking, check with a toothpick. No chunky mix-ins means even baking and allows you to precisely target the texture you want, but it may bake slower than expected due to the nut layer.
