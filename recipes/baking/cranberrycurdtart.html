<h1>BAKING: CRANBERRY CURD TART</h1>
<br>
<p>
Make or otherwise procure a tart crust and par-bake as instructed (you will be returning it to the oven for 10 minutes at the end.) Shortbread is good. 
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, add:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>12oz (1 bag) cranberries
<li>225g (1 cup) white sugar
<li>juice of an orange and a grapefruit, (careful to include no pith) plus their zest (same)
<li>a heavy pinch of salt
</ul>
</p>
<p>
...to a small saucepan. Bring slowly to a boil - do not allow sugars to scorch - and simmer berries til they split and soften, about 10 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Cool til no longer steaming. Meanwhile, beat 2 eggs + 2 yolks til combined. 
</p>
<p>
Immersion blend berries til uniform in color. You can strain it for clarity but I don't bother. Whisk in a stick of butter and cool til no longer steaming (cold butter will help drop the temperature of the curd faster).
</p>
<p>
Once stirring the curd releases no steam, stream  the eggs into it and whisk to combine. 
</p>
<p>
Return to heat and slowly simmer. Remaining liquids will steam off. Stir continuously but lazily (trying not to incorporate too much air) until just bubbling, 10 minutes. 
</p>
<p>
cool til no longer steaming again. Pour into pie crust.
</p>
<p>
Bake at 350 for 10 minutes, rotating halfway through, to set custard. Cool on wire rack.
