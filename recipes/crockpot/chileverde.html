<h1>Crockpot: Chile Verde</h1>
<br>
<p>
You're basically making the sauce here in bulk and poaching the first meal's worth of protein with it. How much you get out of it depends on how much you put in, but 3-4 meals of sauce and 2 meals for two's worth of protein (for example) is typical.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Into a crockpot goes:
<br>
<ul>
<li>12oz (1 bag) tomatillos
<li>4 assorted green peppers (poblano/anaheim/serrano) and optionally a jalapeno, seeded and deveined
<li>1 bunch green onions (greens and whites), chunked
<li>1/2 bunch cilantro (remainder for garnish), rinsed and rough-chopped
<li>1 bunch Culantro, rinsed and rough-chopped
<li>4-6 smashed cloves garlic
<li>1 tbsp toasted and ground cumin seed
<li>salt/msg or chicken powder/black pepper
<li>half a not-bitter beer (or stock/water/etc)
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Nestle a meal or two's worth of lean protein (1-2 lb pork loin or chicken) in with everything else til the protein is fork-shreddable (3-4 hours on high).
</p>
<p>
Remove protein. Stick-blend crockpot contents into a sauce. Reduce with the lid off if necessary, or on the stove if in a rush. 
</p>
<p>
Shred protein and add enough sauce for it to pull together. Salt to taste.
</p>
<p>
Tortillas + protein + extra sauce + cotija + minced (or pickled) onion + cilantro + lime makes great tacos.
