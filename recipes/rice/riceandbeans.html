<h1>Rice and Beans</h1>
<br>
<p>
Saute half an onion of half-mooned onions (lol) and half a chopped fresh chile in oil. This is a good place to get rid of diced etc. pork butt if you have some lying around.
</p>
<p>
Add 1-2 tsp tomato chicken powder, 2 tsp adobo powder, as much cilantro as you want but leave some for later, 1 tsp dried and powdered chiles, 1/2 tsp tumeric and some black pepper. Add maybe some canned adobo pepper juice if you have it, and/or the juice of half a lime.
</p>
<p>
Add more oil to the pot. Well-rinse 200g basmati rice, drain, and add to the pot. Fry the rice in oil, scraping frequently, til the rice is translucent and sticking to the bottom of the pan a little.
</p>
<p>
Add 100g rinsed canned beans here, if you'd like.
</p>
<p>
Deglaze with 250g liquid, water or stock. You can deglaze with alcohol (beer/sake) first and burn the alcohol off and top off with more liquidbut you will need to be mindful of the amounts of liquid you add later vs doing it all at once and knowing it'll work out. Up to you.
</p>
<p>
heat to bubbling and reduce to a simmer and cover, simmering til the liquid is incorporated, 8-10 minutes.
</p>
<p>Scrape up, check for doneness, season, stir in fresh cilantro, fluff with a fork, top with sour cream etc.
