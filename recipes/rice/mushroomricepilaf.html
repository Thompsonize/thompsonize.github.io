<h1>RICE: MUSHROOM RICE PILAF</h1>
<br>
<p>
Rice-a-roni rice pilaf from scratch, plus mushroom and green onion. I ate a lot of this in my 20s. Hits the spot like ramen or mac n cheese and warms you up fast. This is one serving as a meal or 2 as a side; bulks up more or less linearly - go easy on the water as you scale.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>1 tbsp butter
<li>1 large / 2 small white mushrooms, chopped
<li>1 chopped green onion, whites and greens separated
<li>50g medium grain white rice
<li>50g orzo
<li>300ml water
<li>1/4 tsp black pepper
<li>1/4 tsp garlic powder
<li>1/4 tsp paprika
<li>1/8 tsp onion powder
<li>1/8 tsp turmeric
<li>1/8 tsp chicken boullion powder
<li>1/8 tsp salt
<li>parmesan cheese
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add mushroom and onion whites to the pan and sweat til they begin to sizzle. Add rice and orzo and stir to coat. Fry until orzo are browned and smell toasted and rice is bright white. 
</p>
<p>
Add water - the fat will bubble, be wary. Add spices and salts and stir. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce temperature and simmer 12-14 minutes, until all water is absorbed, stirring occasionally. It will be done when there is no liquid left and it has begun to stick to the bottom of the pan, but hasn't yet burned.
</p>
<p>
Remove from heat. Grate an unhealthy amount of parmesan or similar cheese over the top, re-cover, and let sit 5 minutes for orzo to finish softening and release from the bottom of the pan. Stir to combine.
