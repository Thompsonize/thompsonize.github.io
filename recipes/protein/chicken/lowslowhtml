<h1>Chicken: Low and Slow</h1>
<Br>
<p>
I tend to not prepare for dinner so much as walk into the kitchen and look around. In practice this means that I cook straight from frozen a lot.
</p>
<p>
Nothing about this is fast but it's worth it. 
</p>
chicken in cold oven at 1:50. frozen solid. at 325. 
poured off fat at 3:20 (90 minutes)
Flipped skin side down at 3:45 (2ish hours)
<p>
Arrange frozen bone-in chicken pieces in a large cast iron skillet, skin side up. Sprinkle heavily with salt. Put on a medium or low oven rack in a cold oven. Set the oven to 325.
</p>
<p>
Your goal is to render out as much of the fat as possible while not allowing the pieces to boil in their own expressed juices and while getting a good dark brown crust on the bottom of the pieces. This means low and slow, but if you cook the chicken too long, the meat will lose all structuring and get mushy.
</p>
<p>
My way is: After 90 minutes I drain off the accumulated fat.  Once the bottoms of the pieces are slightly brown (approx 30 additional minutes), I flip the pieces to skin side down, salt the bottoms (now up), and return them to the oven.
